# Progress Notes

Code Challenge / Proof of concept

`rails db:seed` to get the initial data once you have everything installed and migrated.

`rails db:reset db:seed` to get a fresh rebuild once already installed.

Use the database.yml.dist as your database.yml (My habit is to not commit that..)

This will come down to a rules engine eventually to do the bulk of the work.  Have me talk to this.
